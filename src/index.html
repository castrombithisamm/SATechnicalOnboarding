                     the students for the global future work and business environment.

                      innovations and entrepreneurship as a source of income. As the chair of the Ajira Club,

                <h3>The African Centre For Women, Information and Communications Technology</h3>
                <P>As an independent contractor, I helped Acwict come up with new programs 
                    and gave the way forward on how these programs should be run by the organization. 
                    They had developed a new platform called AcwcitS4E, both Mobile and Web apps. 
                    Through my guidance and consultation, they launched a new program to assist in 
                    making sure the platform gets known by their target audience.  I also helped in 
                    managing several communities at Acwict via Microsoft Teams. During the Covid19 
                    Digital Employability program, I was given a group of 500 learners to train on 
                    digital literacy. Through my management skills, I organized daily sessions via 
                    Microsoft Teams to train and Coach them.
